  static final paragraph="PaperTale has a unique compensation program that puts equal focus on education as it does on planting the trees. The trees are calculated automatically based on the impact of the purchased garment but then 1 school day is added on top for each garment. School Day is the cost of one-day schooling in the country of production of that particular garment. PaperTale compensation program aims on lifting people out of poverty through the purchase power of consumers. ";
